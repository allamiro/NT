    "## Problem Description \n",
    "In this notebook we looking in to detecting or predicting attacks on industrial control systems ICS using Machine Learning techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Outline: \n",
    "- Apply machine learning techniques to predict attacks on industrial systems using HAI-ICS time series dataset.\n",
    "- Evaluate and analyze HAI dataset time series aspects ( stationary , seasonality ,etc ) and attributes to detect anomalies and thresholds.\n",
    "- Visualize the process and the results using  different machine learning and statistical visualization techniques. \n",
    "- Apply different machine learning models such as  (VAR , ISOLATION FOREST, Logisitic Regression.. etc) and dimensionality reduction technique such as prinicpal component analysis (PCA) to make our prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Industrial Control Systems (ICS) can be found in a variety of places, from automated manufacturing machinery to the cooling system of an office building.\n",
    "ICS were formerly expected to be based on certain operating systems and communication protocols. However, in recent years, network connections based ICS is deplooyed on general-purpose operating systems and common communication protocols have decreased system development costs and increased productivity.\n",
    "These threat actors and rogue states are frequently motivated by financial gain, political purpose, or even a military goal while carrying out assaults. State-sponsored attacks are possible, but so are attacks by competitors, insiders with a hostile intent, and even hacktivists.\n",
    "As a result, the ability to detect abnormalities ahead of time and mitigate risks is a very useful capacity that allows for the prevention of not just cyber assaults, but also downtime, maintenance, and unscheduled downtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem presents another example of anomaly detection and binary classification predictive modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of HAI Dataset: \n",
    "The HAI dataset was collected from a realistic industiral control system (ICS) testbed augmented with a Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) simulator that emulates steam-turbine power generation and pumped-storage hydropower generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains several measurement channels (e.g., sensors, actuators, and control devices) that depict the current state of the systems.It's also available in two variants. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using the last version (21.03) which has a mixture of 20 attack scenarios and 33 interval data.HAI 21.03 was released in 2021, and is based on a more tightly coupled HIL simulator to produce clearer attack effects with additional attacks. \n",
    "\n",
    "The HAI dataset is currently available on the project github page which can be found at <b> (https://github.com/icsdataset/hai)</b>. The data is collected as part of a reseaarch to advance understanding of attack on ICS systems in South Korea. It's worth mentioning there is a comptetion \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset attributes comprised from the followings:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. <b>time</b> : This is the first column and it represents the observed local time as “yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm:ss,” while the rest columns provide the recorded SCADA data points - column 01 \n",
    "2. <b>P1_B2004...P4_HT_LD </b>:  contains data collected from different setpoints and sensors in the process. These values are neumeric values.\n",
    "3. <b>attack</b>: provides an info for whether an attack occured or not{1,0}. Where this is applicable to any attack happening on all the processes.last column.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Identifying Important Attributes (Manual Anlysis of Technical Specs)\n",
    "\n",
    "So analysis of the dataset attributes reveal the fact that there is 80 features. We know nomral scenarios involved operator using 4 controllers and 2 simulation models points (set points) .\n",
    "We also know abnormal scenario occured when some of the parameters were not within the limits of the normal range or in unexpetded states due to attacks, malfunctions, and failures [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "before we work on the dataset attributes and apply our models we need to prepare the dataset. There are  three attack types targeting those systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Setpoints attacks: Forcing setpoints value to change the controlle variables\n",
    "  - Target points attacks: Forcing the control operator value directly.\n",
    "  - Response Prevention attacks: Involves hiding abnormal response on Human Machine Interface HMI (dashboards)\n",
    "    \n",
    "Since our attacks scenarios involved attacking specific controllers that influence the system when different set points and target points values are changed according to the technical details document provided by HAI researchers. \n",
    "\n",
    "We could compile those data and consider the following attributes as good predictors\n",
    "\n",
